DESCRIPTION="Virtual for presence of a Vulkan ICD (Installable Client Driver)"
SRC_URI=""

SLOT="0"
KEYWORDS="*"
IUSE=""

# Include the Vulkan loader as a dependency because an ICD is typically not
# useful without it. A Vulkan client can use an ICD directly, without a loader,
# only if (a) the ICD statically exposes its Vulkan entrypoints (most ICDs
# don't) or (b) the client itself implements the loader interface.
